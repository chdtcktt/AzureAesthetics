    <b>Four-in-One</b>
    <p>Our multi-tasking products, Amazing Base, PurePressed Base, Glow Time and Dream Tint, provide four important functions in one: foundation, concealer, sunscreen and active skin care benefits</p>


    <b>Sun Protection</b>
    <p>Six jane iredale products have earned the Skin Cancer Foundation Seal of Recommendation. To earn this seal, a manufacturer must provide scientific data showing that its products sufficiently and safely aid in the prevention of sun-induced damage to the skin.</p>



    <b>Finishes</b>
    <p>The nature of high quality minerals is to interact with light. This is what gives them their celebrated soft-focus effect. Our line includes a variety of foundations that provide a range of finishes from sheer to full, from luminescent to velvety.</p>


    <b>Coverage</b>
    <p>Because we use pure mineral pigment with no fillers such as talc, our foundations and concealers give exceptional coverage that requires minimal touch-ups.</p>

    <b>Non-comedogenic</b>
    <p>Our foundations form a protective barrier on the skin that allows it to breathe and function normally. Laboratory tests confirm that all of our products are non-comedogenic and do not block pores</p>

    <b>Anti-inflammatory</b>
    <p>We make a conscious effort to include anti-inflammatory ingredients in our products because we believe that this can measurably contribute to skin health.</p>

    <b>Minimum Allergy Risk</b>
    <p>We make a conscious effort to include anti-inflammatory ingredients in our products because we believe that this can measurably contribute to skin health.</p>

    <b>Natural Preservatives</b>
    <p>Where preservatives are needed, we use a combination of natural preservatives, always excluding parabens and phenoxyethanol.</p>
