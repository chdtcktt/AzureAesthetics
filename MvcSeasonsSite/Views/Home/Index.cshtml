        <h3>About Us</h3>
        <p>
            My goal at Azure is for you to find a skin care technician who is passionate, informed and observant.
            I believe that visible skin regeneration needs powerful directed tools that inspire a natural sustainable response that you can continue at home.
            It’s my belief beautiful skin doesn't come from overuse or over-sale of products of any kind. I believe in viewing the skin and body as an environment
            which we must protect, restore and not harm with artificial chemicals, aggressive acids or artificial colors.
            Skin care is problem solving, and one size doesn't fit all, professional skin care is an art and at Azure your skin is our obsession.

        </p>
